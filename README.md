## Installation

NA

## Usage

This application uses the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. These packages, and all others required to run the application are installed by using the following command:


```bash
npm i
```

Once all necessary packages are installed, the next step is to run mysql and source the schema.sql and seeds.sql files, in that order.

Once the database has been created and seeded with mysql, the application is invoked using the follwing command:


```bash
node index.js
```
